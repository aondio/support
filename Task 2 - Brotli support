Hello,

In order to enable Brotli support for Varnish solution please follow below steps:

1. Install vmod_brotli on your varnish environment (you can use the terminal command i.e. "[sudo] apt-get install vmod-brotli" or "yum install vmod-brotli")
2. Add the following lines to your main VCL file in order to enable it's functionalities:

vcl 4.1;
import brotli;
sub vcl_init {
 brotli.init(BOTH, transcode = true);
}
sub vcl_backend_response {
 if (beresp.http.content-encoding ~ "gzip" ||
 beresp.http.content-type ~ "text") {
 brotli.compress();
 }
}

Above command allows varnish to handle the Brotli compression and store them in cache. Clients not supporting brotli compression will receive the transcoded GZIP response instead.
